# Icon Files Required

You need to create two icon files for the Teams app:

## icon-color.png
- Size: 192x192 pixels
- Format: PNG
- Description: Full color app icon used in Teams app store and installation

## icon-outline.png  
- Size: 32x32 pixels
- Format: PNG with transparent background
- Description: Monochrome outline icon used in Teams left rail

## Design Guidelines
- Use your company branding colors
- Keep design simple and recognizable at small sizes
- The outline icon should be a simplified version of the color icon
- Consider using an organization chart or map icon to represent the app functionality

## Tools for Creating Icons
- Adobe Illustrator/Photoshop
- Canva
- GIMP (free alternative)
- Online icon generators

Place these files in the `teams-manifest` folder alongside `manifest.json`.
